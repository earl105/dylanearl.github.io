i am converting my website to be mobile friendly. this is the first change you are to add. reference the screenshot for formatting.

-make the arrows for mobile more offset from the project card itself, as well as making the buttons circular. make them change color when hovered over on mobile.


-laptop region is too small on mobile. if i rotate the laptop i can make it so that it cuts off (the screen can cut it off, but the window shouldnt cut it off), that shouldnt be able to happen.
