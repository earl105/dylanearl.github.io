i am converting my website to be mobile friendly. this is the first change you are to add. reference the screenshot for formatting.

-laptop region is too small. if i rotate the laptop i can make it so that it cuts off, that shouldnt be able to happen.
-skills icons are too low on mobile
-project cards are too narrow on mobile, they should take up the whole screen
-single project displayed at a time is good, but the rotation between the projects is wrong on mobile. it still rotates as if there are three projects on the screen.
