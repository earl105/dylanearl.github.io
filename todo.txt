i am converting my website to be mobile friendly. this is the first change you are to add. reference the screenshot for formatting.

-laptop off center on mobile
-skills icons are too low on mobile
-project cards are too narrow on mobile
-single project displayed at a time is good, but the rotation between the projects is wrong on mobile
-club involvement is out of order on about me on mobile (should be name, about, then involvement)
-make it so there is no images for job experiences on mobile view
-make job experiences fit a single screen on phone (follow the screenshot, no job images)
-make scroll magnetism work on mobile (i think this one is broken because of the fact that the jobs part is broken)
